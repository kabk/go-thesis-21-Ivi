	<!-- abstract -->
  The one great certainty of life is death, yet in western society we often have a hard time coming to terms with that. We are dealing with a shifting baseline syndrome, where the essence of death has almost been forgotten. In day to day life, humans are no longer confronted with death in a natural way. There has been a visualization of death in western society that is rooted in fear. There needs to be a systematic shift from disconnect to symbioses that will turn fear into harmony. We need to change the cultural hero system in which human significance is rooted in being alive, and separated from the essence of life itself. Embracing, and re-visualising death as something natural and beautiful could diminish fear, anxiety and most of all reshape our way of living to a more positive, curious and free one. This paper explores manners in which we can achieve exactly that.
